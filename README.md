<h3>Overview</h3>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<h5>Create a web application using HTML,CSS,Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work.</h5>

<h2>Project Context:</h2>
<h5>We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort,selection sort,insertion sort,merge sort,quick sort and heap sort.But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work.So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.</h5> 

<h2>High-Level Approach</h2>
<h5>-Creating the website's User Interface(UI) using HTML,CSS and enhancing it further using Bootstrap; without actually implementing any of the app's core features.</h5>
<h5>-Implementation of animations ,effects and core functionalities(sorting algorithms) using Javascript.</h5>
